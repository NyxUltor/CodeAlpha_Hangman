# Hangman game — CodeAlpha Internship Task 1

This project was created for **Task 1** of the CodeAlpha Python Internship.  
It is a Python version of the classic Hangman game — but with a little twist. Instead of boring word lists, this version uses meme references.

---

# Goal

Build a basic text-based game using loops, conditionals, and string handling

Chosen Game:  
- Hangman — player guesses letters of a hidden word  
- Tracks lives, incorrect guesses, and victory/loss  
- Displays win/loss messages in meme style  

# Key Concepts Used

- `while loop` — to keep the game running  
- `if-elif-else` — to handle player logic  
- `string` -to display word progress  
- `list` — to manage guessed letters  
- `random` — to select meme words  
- `print()` — to display results and current lives and number of words guessed

# How It Works

1. The game randomly selects a word from a **meme-themed word list**
2. The user guesses letters, one at a time
3. Wrong guesses reduce lives
4. Correct guesses fill in the blanks
5. Player either **guesses the full word** or **loses all lives**
6. A meme-worthy win/loss message is shown at the end


# Sample Words Included

- `"sus"`  
- `"simp"`  
- guess the rest yourself bruh
